Adds Watergazing spot where pawns can stand and look at the water as a medative joy activity.

There is a version of this in the mod [[RF] Advanced Bridges Continued [1.0+]](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2042301222) but this standalone version can be used in vanilla or alongside any bridge-mod.

Made the placement a bit more intuitive, pawns can look at impassible watertypes and it should also never be attacked by raiders or wake up mechanoids.
